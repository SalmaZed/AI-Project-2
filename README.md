# AI-Project-2
This is a project implemented for an introductory course to AI at the German University in Cairo (GUC).

It is composed of a logic-based search agent which operates by storing sentences about the world
in its knowledge base, using an inference mechanism to infer new sentences, and using
these sentences to decide which action to take in order to construct a search plan.
